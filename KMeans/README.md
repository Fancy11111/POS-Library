# [k-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)

Note: k-means is the general name for clustering algorithms.

The algorithm implemented here is based on [Lloyd's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm).

## Setup
k: number of Clusters
1. Create k random Points (within the boundaryies of the possible point values)

## Algorithm
do

1. Assign every point to the nearest cluster
2. recalculate the center of the clusters

aslong as something changes
